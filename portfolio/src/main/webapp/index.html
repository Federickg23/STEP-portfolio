I'm currently a rising junior at Colubmia University in the City of New York (And more specificially the FU Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science). Now that the fancy names are all out of the way, I have been programming since my freshman year of High School, in 2014, and I have learned so much in that span. Whether by picking up Java in AP Computer Science, Python and other languages in Google's CSSI program, or experimenting on my own. I've always enjoyed CS ever since I've discovered it, and hope to futher expand upon my skills!

             <span class="flex-item"> <p class="flex-item"> I have a variety of interests, both in terms of CS material and otherwise. Some of the courses I've had the privilege to take so far include Artificial Intelligence, Visual Interfaces and Advanced Programming, along with other courses. Some of my interests lie in the linguistics field, so I'm rather excited to learn about Spoken Language and Natural  Languages processing in the coming years. I also enjoy discovering how things work, so Programming Languages and Translators lies somewhere in my (hopefully near) future.
