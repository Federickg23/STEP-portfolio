                <span class="flex-item" > <p class="flex-item"> My name is Federick Gonzalez! I'm currently a rising junior at Colubmia University in the City of New York (And more specificially the FU Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science). I have been programming since my freshman year of High School, in 2014, and I have learned so much in that span. Whether by picking up Java in AP Computer Science, Python and other languages in Google's CSSI program, or experimenting on my own. I've always enjoyed CS ever since I've discovered it, and hope to futher expand upon my skills!

             <div class="flex-item">
             <span class="flex-item"> <p class="flex-item"> I have a variety of interests, both in terms of CS material and otherwise. Some of the courses I've had the privilege to take so far include Artificial Intelligence, Visual Interfaces and Advanced Programming, along with other courses. Some of my interests lie in the linguistics field, so I'm rather excited to learn about Spoken Language and Natural  Languages processing in the coming years. I also enjoy discovering how things work, so Programming Languages and Translators lies somewhere in my (hopefully near) future.

            <span class="flex-item"style="margin-top:80px;"><p >Now that the academic information is out of the way, a little more about me. I was born in Miami, Florida, though recently I spend a majority of my year in New York. As someone who really enjoys the cold, it is quite a welcome change to see seasons in a place where I reside! I have a variety of interests and hobbies, and spend most of my free time either doing Wushu, listening to music, playing music, or drawing. Occasionally I take photos as well! I am a trombone player, and have been for about 10 years at this point. I am now a member of Columbia Pops, an orchestra that plays popular music, and soon I'll be a conductor as well! I am also the President of Columbia Wushu, which is a performance-based martial arts group. In the rest of the time, I'm also a Dungeon Master, a DND Player, and a member of my school's Game Development Club. It's a busy schedule, but it's all enjoyable!</p></span>
            <span class="flex-item"style="margin-bottom:60px;"><p>As previously stated, I have multiple interests, and have held multiple for the majority of my life. This is one of the things that has always attracted me to computer science, it has countless possibilities and seemingly infinite applications. When I discovered Computer Science, I was just a freshman in high school who imagined that I would be a doctor or biomedical engineer of some sort, not knowing what I was getting myself into. I discovered programming in the context of robotics, learned that it can be used to create applications, then found out how to make websites and realized just how versatile it is. I really enjoy the fact that each problem is like a puzzle, there is not always a clear solution, and you have to work and test to find out how to solve it, usually b y doing something clever and discovering there was something incredibly simple you just hadn't thought of. It has always been fun, and as I learn more about the field, my interest continues to grow. I hope to stay in the field as long as possible, and build up my list of completed projects! </p></span>
