      <h1>Music and Martial Arts</h1>
      <h3 style="text-align: left;">Music has been a big part of my life for as long as I can remember.
        Whether playing my trombone for school, going to orchestra and jazz practice on weekends, or 
        listening to music while working (And even when writing this webpage), music has always been 
        present. Currently, I am a member of the 
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAaUAFeRINTEPoMOsW3pdfg">Columbia Pops orchestra</a>, 
        and I've included some of our amazing work below. More recently I have found a place as a member
        of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ColumbiaWushu">Columbia Wushu</a>, a performance based 
        martial arts group, though it is admittedly not my first experience in the realm of martial arts.
        These two groups make up the communities in which I've found most of my friends, and I'm glad to 
        be a part of them! Below I have some pics and videos so you can have a better idea of what both 
        groups entail!<h3>

        <span><p>Something most people know about me is that I'm a fan of The Lord of the Rings series, 
          both the films and the books. I've especially always loved the music, and the first practice 
          ever attended for pops consisted of playing this piece. Here is the final project, props to 
          Simon Broucke for the wonderful arrangement.

        <span><p>Here are some chamber performances. This was the first time I had members of my orchestra 
          play a piece I had written, the Imagine Dragons medley. It was amazing to hear people play 
          something I'd written, and it inspired me to create another piece for the entire orchestra, 
          which will hopefully be played in the coming semester.

        <span><p>This video is my first ever wushu performance, after only a month of learning Wushu. 
          I've improved so much since then, but it's good to look back at where I started occasionally.
          Plus, everyone's wushu looks realy good here!

        <span><p>This is our end of the year performance from freshman year, after a whole year of 
          wushu training! It was really well put together, and I'm so glad to have been a part of it,
          the process was really really fun, and all the members are great.
